## DecoMetDIA
DecoMetDIA was developed to process SWATH-MS based data for metabolomics. For detail, please read our recent publication on Analytical Chemistry (dio:doi.org/10.1021/acs.analchem.9b02655)

## Install
DecoMetDIA was developed as an R package with Rcpp code. Compiling is needed when installing. On Windows OS, RTools should be installed first. Please follow the [introduction on CRAN](https://cran.rstudio.com/bin/windows/Rtools/).

The install can be done with ```install_github()```  method in devtools as following:
``` R
devtools::install_github("ZhuMSLab/DecoMetDIA")
```
